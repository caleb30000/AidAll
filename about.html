                <p class="about1">What is AidAll?</p>
                <p>AidAll is an independent platform helping to connect the needy with potential donors.</p>
                <p>This website is a public bulletin. We encourage everyone with spare properties to post a listing and to mark their listing as filled once they have successfully donated.</p>
                <p class="about2">Who developed this website?</p>
                <p>AidAll was developed by <a href="">Abraham Ogudu</a>, a Front End Website Developer with 1+ years of experience.</p>
                <p>You can contact me for inquiries at: <a href="mailto:abrahamogudu@gmail.com">abrahamogudu@gmail.com</a></p>
                <p>To make donations, click <a href=" ">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="about3">Why did I make this website?</p>
                <p>I made AidAll so that needy people could get in contact with potential donors as fast as possible.</p>
                <p class="about4">What information do you need?</p>
                <p>For the needy,  asks for your nearest city to display the closest listings. We do not track your precise location.</p>
                <p>We provide the needy with a guide of some safety notes for contacting donors. The needy are ultimately responsible for their own safety.</p>
                <p class="about5">Special Thanks</p>
                <p>I give special thanks to God for planting this grand idea in my mind and giving me the ability to finalize and actualize it.</p>
